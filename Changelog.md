## [4.7.2] - 2024-09-22

- [apple2] fix finding device bug that was breaking network id and not setting correct device id
- [clock apple2gs] fix clock implementation

I moved the apple2gs C code into the apple2 path, and tested apps against it.
Adds 160 bytes to the application vs ASM version, but does produce runnable applications.
This should now work with apple2gs.

## [4.7.1] - 2024-09-21

- [clock] add apple2gs clock implementation (untested)

## [4.7.0] - 2024-09-20

- [clock] a simple clock library to interface with FujiNet clock device with atari/apple2 (cc65) implementations

## [4.6.2] - 2024-09-15

- [apple2 bus] refactor all sp_get_xxx functions, moving common code into sp_find_device

## [4.6.1] - 2024-09-14

- [network atari] Small tweak to ensure translation byte not lost when performing open, using stack instead of tmp variable which may get corrupt
- [fuji apple2] Use "THE_FUJI" for fujinet device lookup instead of old hack for FUJI_DISK_0
- [SP apple2] Improved and shortened SmartPort apple2 code by going back to assembler, but also looking for devices by TYPE instead of name
  which removes some quite expensive string functions. Saved 256 bytes on a simple "appkey" application.

## [4.6.0] - 2024-09-01

- [network] Add network_http_post_bin function to allow sending binary data instead of text, allowing for 00 char to be sent.

## [4.5.3] - 2024-08-30

- network_read and network_read_nb will exit if there is a general error.
  network_read will set fn_bytes_read to the bytes read into the buffer so far, for client to decide what to do.

## [4.5.2] - 2024-08-25

- [atari] fuji_read_appkey no longer uses malloc, but requires the data buffer passed in to be at least 2 bytes larger than the keysize to work.

## [4.5.1] - 2024-08-24

- [atari] set dtimlo to 1 for appkey read, 2 for appkey write to reduce timeouts when reading / writing a new appkey
- [adam] initial implementations of network, no release

## [4.5.0] - 2024-08-08

- [apple2] send the network unit number with the payloads for network calls to allow for multiple network sub-devices on a SP network device
- [apple2] convert apple2 asm files to C for almost all network functions and bus calls

## [4.4.0] - 2024-07-28

- [cbm] Network Library first release for C64!

## [4.3.1] - 2024-06-30

- [network] fix network_unit return value

## [4.3.0] - 2024-06-30

- [cbm] Implement hash functions in commodore.
- Remove fuji-hash-length implementations from all platforms, as it doesn't work. fuji-hash-size is its replacement.
- [atari] fix appkey arrays/pointers
- [make] Use new makefile structure
- [coco] Use same makefiles as other targets
- [apple2] change sp_init/sp_dispatch to use self modifying code to fix page boundary issue and replace _sp_dispatch_fn for _sp_dispatch_address

## [4.2.0] - 2024-06-19

- Implement commodore fujinet-lib functions
- Add fuji_open_directory2 prototype for applications to send path and
  filter separately rather than in fixed 256 byte buffer with \0 delimiter. Used by CBM.
- Rework Hash API, provide simpler interface
- Fill in some COCO parameters in FUJI calls

## [4.1.4] - 2024-06-05

- Fix sp_init again! Thanks again to @shunkita for noticing I'd broken their update.

## [4.1.3] - 2024-06-03

- Fix sp_init to find any SP device with network device, skipping past any higher cards if they don't have it

## [4.1.2] - 2024-05-20

Bugfix:

- [apple2] fix sp_find_device to not stop on error devices when finding names (thanks Eric Carr)

## [4.1.1] - 2024-05-14

- Enhance build to produce target specific versions of the library, e.g. apple2enh from apple2 src.
  The appkey application was failing in apple2enh without the specific version of the library.

- [apple2] convert network_open src from asm to c

Bugfix:

- [apple] sp_read was incorrectly calling sp_open :scream:

## [4.1.0] - 2024-05-12

### AppKeys Changes

Appkeys have been redesigned for simpler usecases.
Using appkeys now involves first calling `fuji_set_appkey_details` to define the creator, appid, and key size.

Then you call either "fuji_appkey_read" and "fuji_appkey_write".
The old "open" phase is done internally by the API and not exposed.

Clients must provide a pointer for the read/write data buffer to read from and write to.
All structs have been removed in preference of calling functions with parameters directly.

There is a paramter for the appkey size, which is a placeholder for future changes to support larger key sizes
than just 64 bytes.

### [apple2] Asm to C

I've replaced most of the SmartPort asm bus code with C versions.

This makes it way easier to support. The ASM was getting quite tricky to follow, and I wrote the bloody thing.
The only one that shouldn't change to C is sp_dispatch, as it uses self modifying code techniques.

## [4.0.0] - 2024-05-06

- [appkey] Update signature of appkey functions to return bool instead of uint8_t
- [appkey] Change return values of appkey to indicate SUCCESS status to be consistent with other functions
- [hashing] All hashing/base64 functions have been updated similarly to return bool status of success instead of error

## [3.0.4] - 2024-05-05

- [apple2] Add appkey support (thanks Eric Carr)
- [cbm] Start of commodore support in fujinet
- [coco] Start of coco support

## [3.0.3] - 2024-04-02

Bugfix release:

- [apple2] fix network_status on apple2enh by setting y specifically
- replaced BUILD_APPLE2 and BUILD_ATARI in favour of cc65 macros __APPLE2__ and __ATARI__

## [3.0.2] - 2024-03-24

This should be considered the BASE 3 release.

- network_read signature changed to indicate the bytes fetched instead of status, and errors returned as negative
- network_json_query signature similarly changed
- added network_read_nb for non-blocking reads that only fetch up to the amount available in the buffer.
  It is up to the client to loop to fetch the total required rather than the library.

## [3.0.1] - 2024-03-19

This release has been removed, as starting with 3.0.2 the network_read signature has changed and I didn't want to bump to 4.0
given noone has used 3 yet. Sorry purists!

Complete Apple2 fuji device support for CONFIG.

- [apple2] fixes for mount_host_slot and mount_disk_image
- [apple2] don't call FN for get_device_enabled_status, as it's broken
- [apple2] add fuji_disable_device and fuji_enable_device implementations
- [apple2] fix control commands that were not setting the payload parameters
- [apple2] fix fuji_set_device_filename payload length

## [3.0.0] - 2024-03-18

This release has been removed, as starting with 3.0.2 the network_read signature has changed and I didn't want to bump to 4.0
given noone has used 3 yet. Sorry purists!

- Contains signature breaking changes for:
  - network_read, fuji_scan_for_networks, fuji_get_hsio_index, fuji_get_wifi_status, fuji_get_directory_position,
  - fuji_get_device_slots, fuji_get_host_slots
- The great rename fn_io_ to fuji_ to reflect device in FN being used, version bump to 3.0.0 to reflect huge name changes
- Made most fuji_ functions return success status rather than void.
- fuji routines to Apple2 - all but hashing/base64 and appkey stuff
- Add find methods for clock, cpm, modem, printer
- Clean up atari error handling

## [2.2.1] - 2024-02-21

- Renamed libs and archives to reflect name change from "fujinet-network" to "fujinet-lib"
- Libs are now "fujinet-{target}-{version}.lib
- Zips is now fujinet-lib-{target}-{version}.zip
- Header and include files are still fujinet-io.{h,inc} and fujinet-network.{h,inc} to represent their sub-function within fujinet-lib

## [2.2.0] - 2024-02-20

- Change signature of fn_io_mount_disk_image, and fn_io_mount_host_slot to return an error code, so all fn_io_mount* functions are consistent (fixes #2).
- [atari] fn_io_mount_disk_image returns error code from BUS
- [atari] fn_io_mount_host_slot returns error code from BUS
- [atari] added test cases for BUS errors for fn_io_mount_disk_image, fn_io_mount_host_slot, fn_io_mount_all

## [2.1.5] - 2024-01-07

### Fixed

- [apple2] sp_init multiple SP device detection (thanks @ShunKita)

## [2.1.4] - 2024-01-06

### Fixed

- [apple2] network_json_query removes any trailing CR/LF/0x9b in results as last character

### Changed

- [apple2] reduced payload memory from 1024 to 512.

## [2.1.3] - 2024-01-03

### Changed

- [apple2] sp_init looks from slot 7 down to 1 instead of up from 1 to 7
- [apple2] sp_init now additionally looks for an SP card WITH the network adapter on it, which should skip other installed SP devices
- [apple2] sp_init only runs once and stores network id, close no longer resets it.
- lots of tests fixed (cycle count errors mostly)
- add network_init to detect network errors early. Implemented on APPLE2, nop on atari.
  Note: network_open still checks if appropriate init has happened on apple, but network_init will do same thing first, and then open will use the results from init.

## [2.1.2] - 2024-01-03

### Changed

- network_read handles chunked and delayed loading, and is common cross platform C file
- refactored subdirectories of apple code in preparation for fn_io for apple2

## [2.1.1] - 2023-12-07

### Changed

- Set `_sp_network` after calling `sp_find_network` in apple2 so ioctl can work after finding a network without calling open
